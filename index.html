                                have submitted their pre-registrations of their designs, but before the data collection
                                starts, we will specify a standardized way to analyze the data and
                                the exact hypotheses and tests as an addendum to the initial PAP.

                                studies that do not fit the above-mentioned criteria. Borderline criteria will be voted
