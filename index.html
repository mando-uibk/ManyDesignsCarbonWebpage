                                have submitted their pre-registrations of their designs, but before the data collection
                                starts, we will specify a standardized way to analyze the data and
                                the exact hypotheses and tests as an addendum to the initial PAP.

                            In general the experiment follows the protocol shown in the illustration above - parts of experiment shown in white are provided by
                        the project coordinators (PCs); green parts are submitted by selected research teams (RTs) in their proposals. In total the experiment
                            is estimated to last 15 minutes, where 7-8 minutes are attributed to the intervention.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>INTRO:</b> Participants will go through an general introduction of the experiment including a given consent and
                            a CAPTCHA task.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           <b>INTERVENTION:</b> After the general introduction
                            participants are randomly forwarded to one of two treatment conditions
                            (i.e., either CONTROL or POLICY) of the 42 selected designs, where also the measure for real-world support for the social price of carbon
                            (also proposed by the RTs in their desing)
                            is elicited. The proposed design by the RTs have to adhere to the <a class="hyperlink" href="#design_conditions">design conditions</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p> <b>EX-POST QUESTIONS:</b>
                            Following that, participants fill out an ex-post questionnaire provided by the PCs (RTs get the otree app or qualtrics instance to incorporate
                            the ex-post questionnaire into their software from the PCs). The particular questions included can be seen in the pre-analysis plan on

                        <p>
                            <b>END:</b> Having answered the ex-post questionnaire, participants are reached the end of the experiment and will get their payout
                            (i.e., flat fee of 1.50 GBP plus a potential bonus of max. 1.50 GBP; the latter is up to the RTs).
