                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <h4>What?</h4>

                <p>
                    Research teams (RTs) are solicited to participate in a project examining the <span
                        class="highlight">experimental design variability in behavioral economics</span>. In particular,
                    the project focuses on the variablity in experimental designs when the same research question is
                    examined by different research teams. The goal is to explore variation in experimental designs and
                    to estimate a metascientific effect of competition on moral behavior
                </p>

                <p>
                    All participating RTs will propose <span class="highlight">an experimental research design with the objective of analyzing the impact of competition on moral behavior</span>
                    fulfilling a certain set of criteria by <span class="highlight">submitting a pre-registration</span>.
                    In the pre-registration, each RT will propose a linear model for analyzing the data. The project
                    coordinators (PCs) will analyze the data as proposed in each RTs' pre-registration, as well as using
                    their own specifications as outlined in the PCs' pre-analysis plan. All RTs will be anonymized prior
                    to reporting or subsequent sharing of the submitted results.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Stage 1, potential RTs express interest in participating and sign-up to #ManyDesigns. Given that
                    the RT fulfill the requirements, participating RTs move on to Stage 2, where they then will submit a
                    design proposal following a given pre-registration template, outlining the key parameters of their
                    proposed experiment. If more than 50 submitted design proposals are eligible for participation, 50
                    designs will be randomly selected for being included in the study. In Stage 3, each of the up to 50
                    selected design proposals will be implemented as an online experiments using Prolific. RTs are
                    programming the software for their submitted design proposals and are hosting the software while the
                    experiment is conducted and paid for by the project coordinators (PCs). In Stage 4, all RTs will be
                    asked to read 10 other design proposals, submitted by their peers, and evaluate them using a short
                    questionnaire.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We expect that the total workload for research teams participating in the project will be between
                    two and three weeks.
                </p>


                <h4>When?</h4>

                <p>
                    The project coordinators recruit research teams (RTs) between April and May 2021. Eligible RTs will
                    design their experiment and submit their proposals by June 25, 2021. During the summer, all selected
                    RTs will program the experimental software for their submitted designs and submit their software and
                    instructions by October 1, 2021. Starting in October 2021 (estimated), pilot sessions for all
                    experiments will be run to confirm feasibility. Starting in November 2021 (estimated), all selected
                    experiments will be conducted online using Prolific. Data analysis by the project coordinators will
                    start after data collection of all selected experiments have been completed. The overall project
                    will last until summer 2022 with the goal of having a first draft of the paper ready. For a detailed
                    schedule of the project, please refer to the <a class="hyperlink" href="index.html#timeplan">schedule</a>.
                </p>


                <h4>Why participate?</h4>


                <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                    <li>In addition to being part of a fascinating project, you will get the chance to satisfy the
                        curiosity of the academic in you, hungry for answers to a highly relevant and controversial
                        research question.
                    </li>
                    <li>For the proposals selected for implementation, the project coordinators will cover the costs for
                        participant payments.
                    </li>
                    <li>If your proposal is selected for implementation, you will become co-author on the paper that
                        targets publication in a top scientific journal.
                        The PCs previously organized a related but different type of crowd-analysis in neuroscience,
                        published in Nature in 2020 (see here).
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <h4>Who?</h4>


                <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                    <li>RTs consist of one or two participants.
                    </li>
                    <li>At least one of the members of the RT has to hold a PhD in Economics, Psychology or a related
                        field and at least one team member needs one experimental study that is either published
                        (accepted for publication) or a working paper.
                    </li>
                    <li>The team should be sufficiently skilled in experimental methodology and should be familiar with
                        the conceptualizing and implementing (programming) an economic online experiment.
                    </li>
                    <li>RTs need to sign up to participate by filling out a brief survey about background
                        characteristics and expertise in behavioral and experimental economics.
                    </li>
                    <li>The PCs will then decide whether the RT is sufficiently qualified to participate by majority
                        voting.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Experimental software</h4>

                <p>Once research teams (RTs) have been notified that their design has been selected, they have more
                    than three months time to provide the <span class="highlight">experimental software including experimental instructions</span>.
                    All selected designs will be implemented as an online experiment on Prolific with up to 400
                    observations. RTs therefore have to make sure that their experimental software adheres to the
                    following <span class="highlight"> software conditions</span>:

                    submitted pre-registration, subject to one condition: <span class="highlight">a linear model using ordinary least squares (OLS)</span>
                    has to be estimated, with moral behavior as the dependent variable and a dummy variable equal to 1
                    for
                    observations from the COMPETITION treatment (and 0 otherwise).

                    <li>... provide their preferred, exact empirical specification to test for a possible competition

                    </li>
                    <li>... provide the PCs with access to the server on which the experimental software is hosted such

                    </li>
                    <li>... submit the raw data directly after the experiment and provide PCs ex ante with a code book

                    The data from each experiment is initially only available to the RT belonging to the particular
                    design proposal and to PCs. RTs will not be allowed to release, publicize, or discuss their
                    results until a first draft of the metascience paper is public (expected in summer 2022).
                    After this period, all data will become publicly available under CC-BY licence and can be used
                    freely.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the final paper to be produced from this project (including analysis of RTs' design proposals,
                    RTs' peer assessments, and RTs' analyses), the project coordinators will draft the manuscript.
                    All members of each RT will be offered co-authorship on the paper(s).
                    Authorship will be limited to RTs who complete all stages of the project; i.e., to those whose
                    design proposal is (randomly) selected to be included, provide appropriate and feasible
                    experimental software, complete the peer assessments, and submit their data by the respective
                    deadlines. Co-authors from the RTs will be given two weeks to review any drafts of papers prior to
                    submission.
